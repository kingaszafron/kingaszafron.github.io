<p>love_letter_to_kraków: |
  i hail from a tiny town in silesia, but i’ve been studying in kraków for a while now, so i’ve picked up a thing or two. as a self-proclaimed expert and unabashed lover of big cities, i’m convinced there’s no better place to study in poland than kraków. here’s my personal guide of places i’d wholeheartedly recommend to any newcomers :)</p>

<p><strong>where’s the best place to get lost?</strong></p>

<p>podgórze – my absolute favorite district. at first, everyone falls head over heels for kazimierz, but the truly cool ones eventually shift their affections to podgórze. just across the vistula (preferably via the lovers’ bridge, because why wouldn’t you?), opposite kazimierz, lies this gem. once the site of the ghetto, it’s now a charming spot full of greenery. visit the park, climb krakus mound, explore podgórze market, and discover a million more cool spots i’ll list below. it’s basically everything i adore in one place.</p>

<p>piasek – closer to the center, and utterly enchanting. brimming with churches and old buildings, it’s a treat for anyone with a soft spot for beautiful architecture.</p>

<p><strong>best streets:</strong></p>

<p>grodzka – home to collegium broscianum, there’s always something happening here. sure, it can be a bit overwhelming with school groups and flyers for the living butterfly museum, but i think every student has a soft spot for it.</p>

<p>augustiańska – all the best kazimierz has to offer is packed into this street: a church, a bookstore, a café, and that irresistible old-world charm!</p>

<p>łobzowska – my personal favorite bike path, and it’s got just the right amount of moody atmosphere.</p>

<p>lea – there’s not much going on here, but i imagine it’s a cozy place to live. it has a snug vibe, with a cinema and the delightful hrabina café</p>

<p>krupnicza – a haven of little cafés, perfect for a stroll! and it’s home to arteteka &lt;33</p>

<p>kanonicza – walking down this street, i feel like a character from the shadow of the wind or marina by zafón—and honestly, that’s enough for me :)</p>

<p><strong>where to go when you’re hungry or thirsty?</strong></p>

<p>mehoffer’s garden – tucked away on krupnicza, near a branch of the national museum, this was once the garden of a polish artist. it’s gorgeous, with a single solitary tree that, in its loneliness, grew wide instead of tall, creating a delightful canopy.</p>

<p>camelot – at the intersection of św. tomasza and św. jana, this café in an old theater is the epitome of old-school charm. highly recommended.</p>

<p>hrabina – on lea, it’s so cozy you’ll never want to leave! the ambiance is spot on, and it’s everything you could wish for.</p>

<p>mezzalians - on kalwaryjska beautiful inside, with a great philosophy on meal prep! lebanese-syrian cuisine. it’s a bit pricey, but totally worth it.</p>

<p>kuku – on szewska, a taste of taiwan! delicious food and an all-around great vibe.</p>

<p>eszeweria – on józefa, a classic spot that’s been around forever, but never disappoints.</p>

<p>gwar – on mostowa, beautifully decorated, with weekday discounts to sweeten the deal!</p>

<p><strong>where to go when your thoughts need space to roam?</strong></p>

<p>carmelites’ garden – not always open, but when it is, it’s a slice of heaven on karmelicka. you’ll forget you’re in the middle of a bustling city.</p>

<p>jordan park – the gold standard of city parks—pleasant, versatile, and a perfect escape.</p>

<p>podgórze park – smaller and more intimate, with winding paths leading up and down hills. there’s an old stadium up there that’s perfect for sitting and thinking, plus a lovely view of podgórze and kazimierz.</p>

<p><strong>where to have a productive study session?</strong></p>

<p>arteteka, a branch of the regional library- on rajska, i already miss the days when i’ll be older and won’t have to come here to cram for exams, but just to soak up the atmosphere. it’s the ideal place, and every city should have something like it.</p>

<p>branch 21 of kraków library – on królewska, a little slice of prl-era nostalgia with a cozy reading room. it’s a great spot, with windows that face south!</p>

<p><strong>where to overcome a reading slump?</strong></p>

<p>tajfuny – on augustiańska, if you haven’t visited tajfuny in kraków yet, what are you even doing?</p>

<p>lokator – on mostowa, a fabulous selection of books, plus their own publishing house. a lovely lady once complimented my reading taste, and we ended up chatting about the philosophy of mathematics - i adored it.</p>

<p>revolutionibus – on podgórze market, last time i was there, they played billie holiday and let you type on an old typewriter—what more could i possibly ask for?</p>

<p>massolit – on felicjanek, a café and bookstore with the best tea you’ll ever have! they’ve got tons of foreign books and loads of classics. if you’ve ever read a book where a charming café is described, you’re probably picturing massolit! those lovely wooden tables, ahh!</p>

<p><strong>and finally, where to let kraków steal your heart?</strong></p>

<p>just get lost, i guess.</p>
